Hi, how're you doing? I'm Karen, my project idea is to make a playful experience based on Golan's Yellowtail.

My original inspiration is Golan Levin’s <a href="http://www.flong.com/projects/yellowtail/">Yellowtail</a>, I've been obsessed with it for quite a long time.

what I really like is the magic of drawing something then becomes real.
I really want to emphasize this magic moment and make it playful to many people.

My idea is to use touch devices for people to draw, and then a giant display to make their drawing come to life.

Via this interaction, people's power is amplified, leaving rooms for thoughts to be provoked.
