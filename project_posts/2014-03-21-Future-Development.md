My ideal scenario of this piece being played is that a huge display screen, or projector to a giant wall, in a public space invites people to participate in simply using their own smart phones or tablets.
![Future Development](../project_images/future_diagram.jpg?raw=true "Future Development")

Therefore, I, here raise some proposal for its future development:

1.  Refine the visual expression:

    a. Try different types of strokes:
      oil-painting, water-color, pencil, etc

    b.Try different themes of drawing:
      Oceans theme: people’s stroke become aquatic organism, swimming on the display;
      Insect theme: what people’s drawing becomes is wormy insects, crawling on the mud.
      Traffic theme: long strokes turn into highways, small dots become vehicles, people could design a traffic system together.

2.  Improve the experience:

  a. Give guidance to people
    Teach people how to draw certain things together so as to make the piece as a whole;
    Show them how all the drawings interact with each other serve as a system, for an instance, a traffic system.

  b. Leave a purpose
    Give people some goals to achieve. Like, a traffic system like won’t easily have car crash, or, moving all the yellow fish to a safe place to avoid the shark.
