My ideal scenario of this piece being played is that a huge display screen, or projector to a giant wall, in a public space invites people to participate in simply using their own smart phones or tablets.
![Future Development](../project_images/future_diagram.jpg?raw=true "Future Development")

Therefore, I, here raise some proposal for its future development:

1.  Refine the visual expression:
    &nbspa. Try different types of strokes:
      &nbsp&nbspoil-painting, water-color, pencil, etc
    &nbspb.Try different themes of drawing:
      &nbsp&nbspOceans theme: people’s stroke become aquatic organism, swimming on the display;
      &nbsp&nbspInsect theme: what people’s drawing becomes is wormy insects, crawling on the mud.
      &nbsp&nbspTraffic theme: long strokes turn into highways, small dots become vehicles, people could design a traffic system together.

2.  Improve the experience:
  &nbspa. Give guidance to people
    &nbsp&nbspTeach people how to draw certain things together so as to make the piece as a whole;
    &nbsp&nbspShow them how all the drawings interact with each other serve as a system, for an instance, a traffic system.

  &nbspb. Leave a purpose
    &nbsp&nbspGive people some goals to achieve. Like, a traffic system like won’t easily have car crash, or, moving all the yellow fish to a safe place to avoid the shark.
