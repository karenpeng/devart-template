With this piece of work basically functioning, it’s a good time for doing some user tests.

I am in the Nature of Code class, which is a great opportunity to show my works to the class and get the feedback from my classmates and the teach Daniel.

This is a huge class with more than twenty people. The experience begins with surprise from people, and then goes down to a little bit chaos. People keep drawing individually, and their strokes are getting on top of each other, making the canvas a mess.

From this test, I know that people like this magic but it’s better if I could provide them with some purpose for it, or, maybe, make it into more game-like, otherwise a massive player experience can easily turn chaotic.


The next day, I present it to my other class: Math for Artist.
This time is much better because I give them guidance of how and what possible to draw, and people start to cooperate with each other.

From these two tests I come down to roughly two ways to improve this work:

1. In terms of massive-player experience, control to a certain degreed is essential. It could be some guidance like asking people to draw certain shapes, or, try to make their drawing move to some targets, or, simply ask them to cooperate to achieve some drawings.
2. A purpose is lack in this piece. Right now it’s totally open. How could you possibly make people to play it for quite a time? So far, I think that cooperation is the key.
